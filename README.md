# NextStar App


This is a Vite + React storefront demo that runs entirely on local mock data.
Product data lives in `src/data/products.js` and the API layer is in `src/api/localClient.js`.

## Running the app

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building the app

```bash
npm run build
```

No external services are required to run the app locally.
